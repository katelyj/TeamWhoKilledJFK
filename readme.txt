Welcome to our final project, PACMAN 2.0!

Team Who Killed JFKate is proud to present our work.
To get started, simply run Game.pde (located in the Game folder) in Processing.

HOW TO PLAY:

You are Pacman, a yellow blob. Move with the arrow keys, and eat all dots in your sight!
Avoid the ghosts, or you will die. But if you turn blue, you can eat them!
Fruits give you extra points, so be on the lookout for them, too.
